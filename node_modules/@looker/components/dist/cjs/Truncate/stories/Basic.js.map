Since animal skins and inflated\n        internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for\n        a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making\n        was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the\n        stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and\n        whey by the rennet from the stomach. There is a legend—with\n        variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this\n        method of storing milk.\n      </Truncate>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;AAKA,IAAAA,MAAA,GAAAC,sBAAA,CAAAC,OAAA;AACA,IAAAC,CAAA,GAAAD,OAAA;AAAsC,SAAAD,uBAAAG,GAAA,WAAAA,GAAA,IAAAA,GAAA,CAAAC,UAAA,GAAAD,GAAA,gBAAAA,GAAA;AAEvB,SAASE,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC9B,OACEN,MAAA,YAAAO,aAAA,CAACJ,CAAA,CAAAK,GAAG;IAACC,QAAQ,EAAE;EAAI,GACjBT,MAAA,YAAAO,aAAA,CAACJ,CAAA,CAAAO,QAAQ,QACPV,MAAA,YAAAO,aAAA,iBAAQ,0CAAgD,CAAC,gmBAUjD,CACP,CAAC;AAEV"}
